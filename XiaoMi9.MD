# `小米9平衡车电池激活`

There is a DB head on the top of the battery pack. The big hole is  the charging and discharging interface, and there is no equipment on hand, so use the charger to activate it. The charger interface has 4 holes, of which 1, 2 are the positive and negative poles of the power supply.

I don’t know the positive and negative, and I don’t know the positive and negative on the battery pack. I can only try and see it. There is a 50% chance that it will be right. In case it is wrong, the reverse is true.

There are numbers on the DB header. The charging and discharging ports are A1 and A2. Connect 1 to A2 and 2 to A1, and power on. When trying to operate, be sure to prepare two wires with insulation sheath.

## `Serious attention:`

The output of the charger is 63V direct current, which is a dangerous voltage, please do not power on when wiring; the output voltage of the battery pack is also very high, do not touch the exposed part when using the wire.
